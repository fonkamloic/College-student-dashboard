# College-student-dashoard
A student project web app which aim to provide, through an interactive dashboard, a well defined interface between the student and it's university.This in the view to ease the interaction between the student and the rest of it's unversity environment and vice versa.

Note: More is still to be implemented but for now, let us just do the basics.

## Technical details

The app is divided into two parts the ["Back end" and the "Front end"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends).The Fackend consist of a server written in nodeJS maintaining a close relationship with a database managed with in mySQL queries.The Front end has not yet been announced by the rest of the team but will surely be implemented with HTML ,CSS ,JAVASCRIPT (JQUERY, AJAX and some other JS libraries).

#### `step 1: Download and install Git`

##### In Linux Distros (Ubuntu, Kali Linux)

 Note: you should "yum" instead of "apt-get" for other distros.Depending on your package manager.(I don't really know much about other linux distribution).
 
##### In Windows (Ubuntu, Kali Linux)
 
Just download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
 
 

#### `step 2: Download and install npm`

##### In Linux Distros (Ubuntu, Kali Linux)

```bash

#### `step 6: add some files and commit(proposed your change) to  the github project`

Due to  my laziness i will redirect you to a clearer explain on the web. [Staging the changes](https://githowto.com/staging_changes) and [Adding a file to a repository using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/).

finally to be fluent in using git, it is advisable to google your problems because it is really really really...... REALLY possible that your problem has been solved elsewhere (and that doesn't go only for git).These are some good ressource to learn git
