# College-student-dashoard
A student project web app which aim to provide, through an interactive dashboard, a means to share and inetract with other student s from other unversities and there by permitting the to:

- Share resources with other students (documents ,answers and even laughs)
- Discuss about a topic like "Google's New operating system"
- Chat privately with other student .....etc 

Note: More is still to be implemented but for now, let us just do the basics.

## Technical details

The app is divided into two parts, the ["Back end" and the "Front end"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends).The Back end part consist of a server written in nodeJS maintaining a close relationship with a database managed with in mySQL queries.The Front end part has not yet been designed by the rest of the team but will surely be implemented with HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT ( JQUERY AJAX and some other JS libraries).

#### `step 7: add some files and commit(propose your change) to  the github project`

Due to  my laziness i will redirect you to a clearer explanation on the web. [Staging the changes](https://githowto.com/staging_changes) and [Adding a file to a repository using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/).

finally to be fluent in using git, it is advisable to google your problems because it is really really really...... REALLY possible that your problem has been solved elsewhere (and that doesn't go only for git).These are some good ressource to learn git
